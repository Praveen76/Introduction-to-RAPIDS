# Introduction to RAPIDS

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that provides an introduction to using RAPIDS for GPU-accelerated data processing and machine learning in Python. The notebook demonstrates how to load, simulate, split data, convert data formats, and train models using RAPIDS.

## Repository Contents

- `Introduction_to_RAPIDS.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook that covers the basics of RAPIDS, including setup, usage, and examples.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this experiment, you will be able to:

- Load, simulate, split data, and check dimensions
- Convert numpy data to DMatrix format
- Set the parameters and train the model

## Getting Started

To get started with the notebook, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support
- Necessary Python packages (listed in the `requirements.txt` file)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Praveen76/Introduction-to-RAPIDS.git
    cd Introduction-to-RAPIDS
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Ensure CUDA and RAPIDS are installed and properly configured on your system. You can find installation instructions on the [RAPIDS website](https://rapids.ai/start.html).

### Usage

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:

    ```sh
    jupyter notebook
    ```

    or

    ```sh
    jupyter lab
    ```

2. Open the notebook `Introduction_to_RAPIDS.ipynb`.

3. Follow the instructions and run the cells in the notebook to learn about and use RAPIDS for GPU-accelerated data processing and machine learning.

## Notes

- The notebook contains various examples and use cases for RAPIDS. Modify the examples as needed to fit your specific requirements.
